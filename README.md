#  Computer Vision - Kaggle Exercises

This repository contains my solutions and practice notebooks for **Computer Vision** concepts on Kaggle.  
Each notebook covers an important building block of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and related techniques.

## Notebooks Included

1. **Convolution and ReLU**  
   - Introduction to convolutional filters and feature extraction.  
   - Application of the ReLU activation function to detect non-linear patterns.

2. **Maximum Pooling**  
   - Demonstrates pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions.  
   - Explains how pooling helps in translation invariance.

3. **The Sliding Window**  
   - Explores the concept of sliding filters across an image.  
   - Shows how convolution kernels capture local features.

4. **The Convolutional Classifier**  
   - Building a CNN end-to-end for classification tasks.  
   - Fully connected layers after convolutional feature extraction.

5. **Custom Convnets**  
   - Creating deeper, customized CNN architectures.  
   - Experimenting with filter sizes, depth, and network structure.

6. **Data Augmentation**  
   - Applying transformations (rotation, flipping, scaling, etc.) to improve generalization.  
   - Using augmentation to expand training datasets.

##  How to Use
Clone this repository and open the notebooks in **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<Kahkashan2708>/Computer-Vision-Kaggle.git
cd Computer-Vision-Kaggle
